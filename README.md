# congestion_analysis
The project deals with a Regression problem.
- The project done was a part of competition hosetd by Kaggle named Tabular Series Playground in March 2022.
- There were 3 CSV files provided; training data, testing data and sample sumbission.
- The training data file had data of date, latitude, longitude, direction and the amount of congestion.
- The task was to predict the congestion values for the given test data, store it in the format of sample submission.
- New columns were created based on the time series analysis.
- Various Algorithms like Linear Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and some boosting algorithms were used and the one with least error was chosen to predict the values for the test dataset.
- The predictions are stored in the submission7 file.
